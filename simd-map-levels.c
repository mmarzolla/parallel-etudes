% Map gray levels

Let us consider a grayscale bitmap with $M$ rows and $N$ columns,
where the color of each pixel is an integer from 0 (black) to 255
(white). Given two values _low, high_, $0 \leq \mathit{low} <
\mathit{high} \leq 255$, the function `map_levels(img, low, high)`
modifies `img` so that the pixels whose gray level is less than _low_
become black, those whose gray level is greater than _high_ become
white, and those whose gray level is between _low_ and _high_
(inclusive) are linearly mapped to the range $[0, 255]$.

Specifically, if $p$ is the gray level of a pixel, the new level $p'$
is defined as:

$$
p' = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if}\ p < \mathit{low}\\
\displaystyle\frac{255 \times (p - \mathit{low})}{\mathit{high} - \mathit{low}} & \text{if}\ \mathit{low} \leq p \leq \mathit{high}\\
255 & \text{is}\ p > \mathit{high}
\end{cases}
$$

Figure 1 shows the image produced by the command

        ./simd-map-levels 100 180 < simd-map-levels-in.pgm > out.pgm

![Figure 1: Left: original image [simd-map-levels-in.pgm](simd-map-levels-in.pgm); Right: after level mapping with `./simd-map-levels 100 180 < simd-map-levels-in.pgm > out.pgm`](simd-map-levels.png)

We provide the image [C1648109](C1648109.pgm) taken by the [Voyager
1](https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/) probe on March 8, 1979. The image
shows Io, one of the four [Galilean moons of the planet
Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_moons). The Flight
Engineer [Linda
Morabito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_A._Morabito) was using
this image to look for background stars that could be used to
determine the precise location of the probe. To this aim, she remapped
the levels so that the faint stars would be visible. This lead to one
of the most important discoveries of modern planetary sciences: see by
yourself by running the program

        ./simd-map-levels 10 30 < C1648109.pgm > out.pgm

and look at what appears next to the disc of Io at ten o'clock...

The file [simd-map-levels.c](simd-map-levels.c) contains a serial
implementation of function `map_levels()` above. The goal of this
exercise is to develop a SIMD version using GCC _vector datatypes_.
We start by defining a vector datatype `v4i` that represents four
integers:

```C
typedef int v4i __attribute__((vector_size(16)));
#define VLEN (sizeof(v4i)/sizeof(int))
```

The idea is to process the image four pixels at a time. However, the
serial code

```C
int *pixel = bmap + i*width + j;
if (*pixel < low)
    *pixel = BLACK;
else if (*pixel > high)
    *pixel = WHITE;
else
    *pixel = (255 * (*pixel - low)) / (high - low);
```

is problematic because it contains conditional statements that can not
be directly vectorized. To address this issue we use the _selection
and masking_ technique. Let `pixels` be a pointer to a `v4i` SIMD
array. Then, the expression `mask_black = (*pixels < low)` produces a
SIMD array of integers whose elements are -1 for those pixels whose
gray level is less than _low_, 0 otherwise. `mask_black` can therefore
be used as a bit mask to assign the correct values to these pixels.

Using the idea above, we can rewrite the code as follows:

```C
v4i *pixels = (v4i*)(bmap + i*width + j);
const v4i mask_black = (*pixels < low);
const v4i mask_white = (*pixels > high);
const v4i mask_map = ??? ;
*pixels = ( (mask_black & BLACK) |
            (mask_white & WHITE) |
            ( ??? ) );
```

The compiler automatically promotes `BLACK` and `WHITE` to SIMD
vectors whose elements are all `BLACK` or `WHITE`, respectively. The
code above can be further simplified since `(mask_black & BLACK)`
always produces a SIMD array whose elements are all zeros: why?.

The SIMD version requires that

1. Each row of the bitmap is stored at a memory address that is
   multiple of 16;

2. The image width is multiple of 4, the `v4i` SIMD vector width.

The program guarantees both conditions by adding columns so that the
width is multiple of 4. The attribute `width` of structure `PGM_image`
is the width of the _padded_ image, while `true_width` is the true
width of the _actual_ image, $\texttt{width} \geq
\texttt{true_width}$.

To compile:

        gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Wpedantic -O2 -march=native simd-map-levels.c -o simd-map-levels

To execute:

        ./simd-map-levels low high < input_file > output_file

where $0 \leq \mathit{low} < \mathit{high} \leq 255$.

Example:

        ./simd-map-levels 10 30 < C1648109.pgm > C1648109-map.pgm

## Files

- [simd-map-levels.c](simd-map-levels.c)
- [hpc.h](hpc.h)
- Some input images: [simd-map-levels-in.pgm](simd-map-levels-in.pgm), [C1648109.pgm](C1648109.pgm)

You can generate input images of arbitrary size with the command:

        convert -size 1024x768 plasma: -depth 8 test-image.pgm
