[Arnold's cat map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold%27s_cat_map)
is a continuous chaotic function that has been studied in the '60s by
the Russian mathematician [Vladimir Igorevich
Arnold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Arnold). In its
discrete version, the function can be understood as a transformation
of a bitmapped image $P$ of size $N \times N$ into a new image $P'$ of
the same size. For each $0 \leq x, y < N$, the pixel of coordinates
$(x,y)$ in $P$ is mapped into a new position $C(x, y) = (x', y')$ in
$P'$ such that

$$
x' = (2x + y) \bmod N, \qquad y' = (x + y) \bmod N
$$

("mod" is the integer remainder operator, i.e., operator `%` of the C
language). We may assume that $(0, 0)$ is top left and $(N-1, N-1)$ is
bottom right, so that the bitmap can be encoded as a regular
two-dimensional C matrix.

The transformation corresponds to a linear "stretching" of the image,
that is then broken down into triangles that are rearranged as shown
in Figure 1.

![Figure 1: Arnold's cat map](cat-map.svg)

Arnold's cat map has interesting properties. Let $C^k(x, y)$ be the
$k$-th iterate of $C$, i.e.:

$$
C^k(x, y) = \begin{cases}
(x, y) & \mbox{if $k=0$}\\
C(C^{k-1}(x,y)) & \mbox{if $k>0$}
\end{cases}
$$

Therefore, $C^2(x,y) = C(C(x,y))$, $C^3(x,y) = C(C(C(x,y)))$, and so
on.

If we apply $C$ once, we get a severely distorted version of the
input. If we apply $C$ again on the result, we get an even more
distorted image. As we keep applying $C$, the original image is no
longer discernible. However, after a certain number of iterations,
that depends on the image size $N$ and has been proved to never exceed
$3N$, we get back the original image! (Figure 2).

![Figure 2: Some iterations of the cat map](cat-map-demo.png)

The _minimum recurrence time_ is the minimum number of iterations $k
\geq 1$ such that produce the original image, i.e., $C^k(x, y) = (x,
y)$ for all $(x, y)$. For example, the minimum recurrence time for
[cat1368.pgm](cat1368.pgm) of size $1368 \times 1368$ is $36$.

The minimum recurrence time depends on the image size $N$ only. No
closed formula is known to compute the minimum recurrence time given
$N$, although there are results and bounds that apply to specific
cases.

You are given a serial program that computes the $k$-th iterate of
Arnold's cat map on a square image. The program reads the image from
standard input in [PGM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm)
(_Portable GrayMap_) format. The results is printed to standard output
in PGM format. For example:

        ./omp-cat-map 100 < cat1368.pgm > cat1368-100.pgm

applies the cat map $k=100$ times on `cat1368.phm` and saves the
result to `cat1368-100.pgm`.

To display a PGM image you might need to convert it to a different
format, e.g., JPEG. Under Linux you can use `convert` from the
[ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) package:

        convert cat1368-100.pgm cat1368-100.jpeg

Modify the function `cat_map()` to make use of shared-memory
parallelism using OpenMP. You might want to take advantage from the
fact that Arnold's cat map is _invertible_, meaning that any two
different points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are always mapped to
different points $(x'_1, y'_1) = C(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x'_2, y'_2) =
C(x_2, y_2)$. Therefore, the output image $P'$ can be filled up in
parallel without race conditions.

To compile:

        gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Wpedantic -fopenmp omp-cat-map.c -o omp-cat-map

To execute:

        ./omp-cat-map k < input_file > output_file

Example:

        ./omp-cat-map 100 < cat1368.pgm > cat1368-100.pgm

## Suggestions

The provided function `cat_map()` is based on the following template:

```C
for (int i=0; i<k; i++) {
    for (int y=0; y<N; y++) {
        for (int x=0; x<N; x++) {
            (x', y') = C(x, y);
            P'(x', y') = P(x, y);
        }
    }
    P = P';
}
```

The two inner loops build $P'$ from $P$; the outer loop applies this
transformation $k$ times, using the result of the previous iteration
as the source image. Therefore, the outer loop can _not_ be
parallelized (the result of an iteration is used as input for the next
one). Therefore, in the version above you can either:

1. Parallelize the `y` loop only, or

2. Parallelize the `x` loop only, or

3. Parallelize both the `y` and `x` loops using the `collapse(2)`
   clause.

(I suggest to try options 1 and/or 3. Option 2 does not appear to be
efficient in practice: why?).

We can apply the _loop interchange_ transformation to rewrite the
code above as follows:

```C
for (int y=0; y<N; y++) {
    for (int x=0; x<N; x++) {
        xcur = x; ycur = y;
        for (int i=0; i<k; i++) {
            (xnext, ynext) = C(xcur, ycur);
            xcur = xnext;
            ycur = ynext;
        }
        P'(xnext, ynext) = P(x, y)
    }
}
```

This version can be understood as follows: the two outer loops iterate
over all pixels $(x, y)$. For each pixel, the inner loop computes the
target position $(\mathit{xnext}, \mathit{ynext}) = C^k(x,y)$ that the
pixel of coordinates $(x, y)$ will occupy after $k$ iterations of the
cat map.

In this second version, we have the following options:

a. Parallelize the outermost loop on `y`, or

b. Parallelize the middle loop on `x`, or

c. Parallelize the two outermost loops with the `collapse(2)` directive.

(I suggest to try option c).

Intuitively, we might expect that (c) performs better than (3), because:

- the loop granularity is higher, and

- there are fewer writes to memory.

Interestingly, this does not appear to be the case (at least, not on
every processor). Table 1 shows the execution time of two versions of
the `cat_map()` function ("No loop interchange" refers to option (3);
"Loop interchange" refers to option (c)). The program has been
compiled with:

        gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Wpedantic -O0 -fopenmp omp-cat-map.c -o omp-cat-map

(`-O0` prevents the compiler from applying code transformations that
might alter the functions too much) and executed as:

        ./omp-cat-map 2048 < cat1368.pgm > /dev/null

Each measurement is the average of five independent executions.

:Table 1: Execution time (in seconds; lower is better) of the command `./omp-cat-map 2048 < cat1368.pgm > /dev/null` using all processor cores, with different implementations of the cat map iteration.

On some platforms (Intel i5, i7 and Raspberry Pi 4) there is little or
no difference between the two versions. Loop interchange provides a
significant performance boost on the very old Intel Atom N570
processor, but provides worse performance on the Xeon processors.

## To probe further

What is the minimum recurrence time of image
[cat1024.pgm](cat1024.pgm) of size $1024 \times 1024$? We can answer
this question without the need for an input image. To understand how,
let us suppose that one particular pixel, say $(x_1, y_1)$, has
minimum recurrence time 15. This means that after 15 iterations, the
pixel at coordinates $(x_1, y_1)$ will return to its starting
position. Suppose that another pixel of coordinates $(x_2, y_2)$ has
minimum recurrence time 21. How many iterations of the cat map are
required to have _both_ pixels back to their original positions?

The answer is $105$, which is the least common multiple (LCM) of 15
and 21. From this observation we can devise the following
algorithmn. Let $k(x,y)$ be the minimum recurrence times of the pixels
of coordinates $(x, y)$, $0 \leq x, y < N$. Then, the minimum
recurrence time of the whole image is the least common multiple of all
$k(x, y)$.  Table 2 shows the minimum recurrence time for some $N$.

:Table 2: Minimum recurrence time for some image sizes $N$

    $N$   Minimum recurrence time
------- -------------------------
     64                        48
    128                        96
    256                       192
    512                       384
   1368                        36
------- -------------------------

Figure 3 shows the minimum recurrence time as a function of
$N$. Despite the fact that the values jumps around, they tend to align
along straight lines.

![Figure 3: Minimum recurrence time as a function of the image size $N$](cat-map-rectime.png)

[omp-cat-map-rectime.c](omp-cat-map-rectime.c) contains an incomplete
skeleton of a program that computes the minimum recurrence time of a
$N \times N$ image. Complete the serial program, and then implement a
parallel version using OpenMP.
