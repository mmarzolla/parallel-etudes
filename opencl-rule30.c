% "Rule 30" Cellular Automaton

The goal of this exercise is to implement the [Rule 30 Cellular
Automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_30) in OpenCL.

The Rule 30 CA is a 1D cellular aotmaton that consists of an array
`x[N]` of $N$ integers that can be either 0 or 1. The state of the CA
evolves at discrete time steps: the new state of a cell depends on its
current state, and on the current state of the two neighbors. We
assume cyclic boundary conditions, so that the neighbors of $x[0]$ are
$x[N-1]$ and $x[1]$ and the neighbors of $x[N-1]$ are $x[N-2]$ and
$x[0]$ (Figure 1).

![Figure 1: Rule 30 CA](mpi-rule30-fig1.svg)

Given the current values $pqr$ of three adjacent cells, the new value
$q'$ of the middle cell is computed according to Table 1.

:Table 1: Rule 30 (■ = 1, □ = 0):

---------------------------------------- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- -----
Current configuration $pqr$               ■■■   ■■□   ■□■   ■□□   □■■   □■□   □□■   □□□
New state $q'$ of the central cell         □     □     □     ■     ■     ■     ■     □
---------------------------------------- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- -----

The sequence □□□■■■■□ = 00011110 on the second row is the binary
representation of decimal 30, from which the name ("Rule 30 CA"); more
details can be found [here](mpi-rule30.pdf).

The file [opencl-rule30.c](opencl-rule30.c) contains a serial program
that computes the evolution of the Rule 30 CA, assuming an initial
condition where all cells are 0 except the central one. The program
accepts two optional command line parameters: the domain size $N$ and
the number of steps _nsteps_ to simulate. At the end, the program
produces the image `rule30.pbm` shown in Figure 2 of size $N \times
\textit{nsteps}$.

![Figure 2: Evolution of Rule 30 CA](rule30.svg)

Each row of the image represents the state of the automaton at a
specific time step (1 = black, 0 = white). Time moves from top to
bottom: the first line is the initial state (time 0), the second line
is the state at time 1, and so on.

Interestingly, the pattern shown in Figure 2 is similar to the pattern
on the [Conus textile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conus_textile)
shell, a highly poisonous marine mollusk which can be found in
tropical seas (Figure 3).

The goal of this exercise is to write a parallel version where the
computation of the new states are performed by OpenCL work-items. In
particular, the `rule30()` function should be turned into a kernel.
Assume that the domain size $N$ is a multiple of the workgroup size
(_SCL_DEFAULT_WG_SIZE_).

I suggest that you start with a version that does not use local
memory; this first version should be easily derived from the provided
serial code.

Since each domain cell is read three times by three different work-item
within the same block, the computation _might_ benefit from the use of
local memory.

> **Note:** The use local memory might produce minor improvements on
> modern GPUs, or even make the program _slower_. The reason is that
> there is little data reuse, and modern GPUs are equipped with caches
> that work reasonably well in these kind of
> computations. Nevertheless, it is useful to practice with local
> memory, so this exercise should be considered as it is: an exercise.

To use local memory, refer to the simple example of 1D stencil
computation that we have seen during the class; in this case, the
radius of the stencil is one, i.e., the new state of each cell depends
on the state of a cell and the state of the two neighbors. Be careful,
since in this exercise we assume a cyclic domain, whereas in the
stencil computation discussed in the class we did not.

![Figure 3: Using local memory](opencl-rule30.svg)

Looking at Figure 2, you might proceed as follows:

- `d_cur[]` is the current state on GPU memory.

- We create a kernel, say `fill_ghost(...)` that fills the ghost area
  of `d_cur[]`. The kernel will be executed by one work-item, since
  only two values need to be copied.

- We create another kernel that computes the new state of the domain,
  given the current state. To this aim, we use a 1D grid of 1D
  workgroups.  Each block defined a `__local` array
  `buf[SCL_DEFAULT_WG_SIZE+2]`; we need `SCL_DEFAULT_WG_SIZE+2`
  elements since we need to include ghost cells in each partition in
  order to be able to compute the new states of all cells.

- Each work-item computes the "local" index `lindex` in the `buf[]`
  array, and a "global" index `gindex` in the `d_cur[]` array, of the
  element it is associated with. Care should be taken, since both the
  local and global domains have ghost cells. Therefore, indices should
  be computed as:
```C
      const int lindex = 1 + get_local_id(0);
      const int gindex = 1 + get_global_id(0);
```

- Each work-item copies one element from global to local memory:
```C
      buf[lindex] = cur[gindex];
```

- The first work-item of each workgroup also fills the ghost area
  of the local array `buf[]`:
```C
      if (0 == get_local_id(0)) {
          buf[0] = cur[gindex-1];
          buf[SCL_DEFAULT_WG_SIZE + 1] = cur[gindex + SCL_DEFAULT_WG_SIZE];
      }
```

To generate the output image, the new domain should be transferred
back to host memory after each iteration. Then, `d_cur` and `d_next`
must be exchanged before starting the next iteration.

To compile:

        cc -std=c99 -Wall -Wpedantic opencl-rule30.c simpleCL.c -o opencl-rule30 -l OpenCL

To execute:

        ./opencl-rule30 [width [steps]]

Example:

        ./opencl-rule30 1024 1024

The output is stored to the file `opencl-rule30.pbm`
