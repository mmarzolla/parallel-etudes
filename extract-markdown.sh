## Use this script to extract comment blocks delimited by `/***` and
## `***/`. The delimiters *must* appear on a line from themselves,
## without any extraneous characters before or after (spaces are ok).
##
## This script also replaces `\/\*` with `/*`, and `\*\/` with `*/` so
## that it is possible to type C-style comments inside comment blocks.

## Usage: ./extract-markdown.sh filename > out
